    "\n",
    "This exercise uses data from a study of **high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)** — one of the most lethal gynaecological cancers, largely because most patients eventually develop resistance to standard platinum-based chemotherapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two major treatment strategies exist, and they attract very different immune landscapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | Abbreviation | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Primary Debulking Surgery | **PDS** | Surgery first, then chemotherapy |\n",

    "\n",
    "Patients are also stratified by their **homologous recombination (HR) status** — a measure of DNA repair capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BRCALoss** — BRCA1/2 mutations impair DNA repair, making tumours more sensitive to certain therapies and more immunogenic\n",
    "- **HRP** (HR-proficient) — intact DNA repair, generally associated with poorer immunotherapy response\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study ([Perez-Villatoro et al., 2026](https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-1492)), different treatment–genotype combinations produced strikingly different **tumour–stroma interfaces (TSI)** — the boundary zone where immune cells either successfully invade the tumour or get blocked.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Spatial context is everything.** The same number of immune cells can have very different clinical relevance depending on *where* they are relative to the tumour.\n",
    "- **Rule-based phenotyping requires validation.** Always sanity-check your classifications with heatmaps and spatial overlays before moving to downstream analysis.\n",
    "- **RCNs are scale-dependent.** The radius parameter is a biological decision, not just a technical one — it determines the spatial scale at which you define \"neighbourhood.\"\n",
