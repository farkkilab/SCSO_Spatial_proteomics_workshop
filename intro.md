# Spatial Proteomics: From Pixels to Phenotypes

Welcome to the **Spatial Proteomics Workshop (2026)**. In this session, we move beyond simple microscopy to explore high-dimensional tissue imaging. You will learn to navigate multiplexed data, manage technical image parameters, and translate raw fluorescence into biological insights.

**Software Check:** No installation is required. We will use [Avivator](https://avivator.gehlenborglab.org/) and the [CycIF Viewer](https://www.cycif.org/), which run directly in your web browser.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* **Evaluate Image Channels:** Explain what specific biological signals represent in a multiplexed stack.
* **Master Visualization:** Adjust contrast, intensity ranges, and colormaps to highlight specific ROI (Regions of Interest).
* **Assess Data Quality:** Identify bit depth, pixel-to-micron scales, and the impact of signal aggregation.
* **Identify Phenotypes:** Relate staining patterns to cell morphology and distinguish between lineage and functional markers.
