## Overview

This workshop introduces computational spatial proteomics analysis — from raw 
multiplexed protein expression to biologically interpretable tissue neighbourhoods. 
All exercises use real high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) TMA data.

| Exercise | Topic |
|----------|-------|
| Exercise 1 | Technical foundations of digital pathology |
| Exercise 2 | Biological interpretation & cell phenotyping |
| Exercise 3 | Spatial architecture of the tumour microenvironment |
